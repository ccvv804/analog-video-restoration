  abstract = {In this paper we present a system to restore analog videos of historical archives. These videos often contain severe visual degradation due to the deterioration of their tape supports that require costly and slow manual interventions to recover the original content. The proposed system uses a multi-frame approach and is able to deal also with severe tape mistracking, which results in completely scrambled frames. Tests on real-world videos from a major historical video archive show the effectiveness of our demo system.},
